### **3. Text-Based Adventure Game**

# - **Concepts:** Loops, conditionals, dictionaries.
# - **Key Features:** User choices affect the outcome.
# - **What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
#     - Nested conditionals (`if-elif-else`)
#     - Using dictionaries for game logic
#     - Structuring a simple game loop


# Game Idea: "Dungeon of Shadows"
# A text-based adventure game where the player explores a dark dungeon, fights monsters, collects treasures, and tries to escape alive.

# Game Features:
# Rooms & Exploration: The player moves between different dungeon rooms, encountering random events.
# Combat System: The player can fight or flee when encountering monsters.
# Inventory System: Collect potions, weapons, and keys to unlock doors.
# Random Events: Traps, treasure chests, or secret passages.
# Win/Lose Condition: Escape the dungeon to win; die from monsters or traps to lose.
# Basic Gameplay Flow:
# Player starts in a dark dungeon with minimal supplies.
# Moves through rooms using commands like "north", "south", "east", "west".
# Encounters random events (monsters, loot, locked doors).
# Chooses to fight, flee, or use items in battles.
# Tries to find the exit before running out of health.
